description: Configuring fonts and glyphs for MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native — the style's `glyphs` URL, self-hosting or generating font PBFs, the GL JS local-font fallback (omitted `glyphs` or a failed glyph fetch), MapLibre Native's `font-faces` property, and Noto/CJK/RTL/Devanagari script handling. Use when text labels aren't rendering in the intended font, setting up a glyphs server, choosing between self-hosting and generating font PBFs, or handling non-Latin scripts.

# MapLibre Fonts and Glyphs

MapLibre doesn't render text with fonts installed on the machine by default. It fetches precomputed glyph images from a server, or (GL JS, since 5.11.0) falls back to local/system fonts. This skill covers where glyphs come from, the GL JS local-font fallback, MapLibre Native's separate `font-faces` mechanism, and non-Latin script support. For font sizing, weight, and other visual-hierarchy decisions, see [maplibre-cartography](../maplibre-cartography/SKILL.md).

## When to Use This Skill

- Text labels aren't rendering, or render in the wrong font
- Setting up a `glyphs` URL for a custom or self-hosted style
- Deciding whether to self-host existing font PBFs or generate your own from a TTF/OTF
- Rendering non-Latin scripts (CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, and others)
- Rendering fonts locally/offline without a glyphs server, on GL JS or Native

## MapLibre renders text using SDF glyphs

MapLibre renders text using **SDF (signed-distance field) glyphs** — precomputed font files that scale cleanly at any zoom or screen density, served from a URL matching the style's `glyphs` field. **In GL JS ≥ 5.11.0** ([PR #4564](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/4564)), an unresolvable `glyphs` situation is no longer fatal: MapLibre renders text locally via TinySDF instead, treating `text-font` as a cascading list of local/web font names. This covers two cases:

- **`glyphs` omitted entirely.** A first-class local-fonts mode, not just error recovery. Every `text-font` name is resolved as a web font (loaded with `@font-face` or `document.fonts.load()`) or a system font, the same way a browser resolves a CSS `font-family` list. No PBF generation, no glyph server. See the [local fonts](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/style-labels-with-local-fonts/) and [web fonts](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/style-labels-with-web-fonts/) examples.
- **`glyphs` is set but a specific glyph PBF fails to load** (wrong font name, 404, etc.). The same local-render path fires per glyph range instead of failing the tile, logging `Unable to load glyph range ... Rendering codepoint U+... locally instead.` Treat this as **cosmetic**, not correctness: the text renders in a generic local/system font that varies by OS/browser, but doesn't go invisible or break the layer.

The PR author's own caveat still holds: **this is GL JS only.** The PR text declines to "encourage style authors to rely on non-CJK local text rendering yet," since Native still needs matching Android and iOS implementations for interoperability. A style that must look the same on GL JS and Native should keep serving glyphs explicitly instead of relying on the fallback.

**Native's equivalent is a different property, not the same one.** Native doesn't support omitting `glyphs` to fall back to local fonts (tracked, still open: [maplibre-native#165](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues/165)). Instead it has its own `font-faces` property (Android ≥ 11.13.0, iOS ≥ 6.18.0 — **not implemented in GL JS**, [gl-js#6637](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/6637)), mapping each `text-font` name to one or more local font files with an explicit Unicode range you specify yourself. Same goal as GL JS's fallback — offline rendering without a glyph server — but manual instead of automatic: you get exact control over which file covers which codepoints, at the cost of working out those ranges yourself. Don't port `font-faces` config to a GL JS style, or the GL JS omit-`glyphs` pattern to Native — the two SDKs solve local fonts with unrelated mechanisms today.

## Setting the glyphs URL

The style's `glyphs` field is a URL template ending in `/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf` (e.g. `https://demotiles.maplibre.org/font/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`), where `{fontstack}` is the comma-joined `text-font` list and `{range}` a Unicode range — full mechanics: [style spec — glyphs](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/glyphs/). `text-font` is itself a fallback list — see [Noto for global maps](#noto-for-global-maps) below.

## Font options

| Source                                | Fonts available                                                                          | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `demotiles.maplibre.org/font`         | Noto Sans (Latin, Arabic, CJK, etc.), Noto Sans Bold, Italic                             | Free, publicly hosted; good for prototyping              |
| OpenMapTiles `fonts.openmaptiles.org` | Klokantech Noto Sans family                                                              | Matched to OMT schema styles                             |
| Self-hosted, existing font            | Reuse prebuilt PBFs (openmaptiles/fonts, UNDP-Data/fonts, or your current server's tree) | Full control; no generation needed for standard fonts    |
| Self-hosted, custom font              | Generate PBFs from your own TTF/OTF                                                      | Only needed when no prebuilt PBF set exists for the font |

**For standard fonts (Noto Sans, Open Sans, Roboto, and similar), you don't need to generate anything.** The simplest path is copying the `{fontstack}/{range}.pbf` tree a glyph server already serves (e.g. the one your style currently points at) onto your own origin. [openmaptiles/fonts](https://github.com/openmaptiles/fonts) and [UNDP-Data/fonts](https://github.com/UNDP-Data/fonts) package the common standard fonts as glyph PBFs you can build or pull. Both also run hosted endpoints of their own — third-party servers, so skip those if self-hosting is the point. Point the style's `glyphs` field at your own URL template; the font names in your `text-font` arrays must exactly match the served font-stack folder names.

**Generating glyphs from a TTF/OTF is a separate, heavier task** — only needed for a custom or brand font with no existing PBF set. Use [Font Maker](https://maplibre.github.io/font-maker/) or [fontnik](https://github.com/mapbox/fontnik) to produce the `.pbf` files, then serve and reference them the same way as above.

## Noto for global maps

Noto ("no tofu") is Google's open-source family built for near-universal Unicode coverage: Noto Sans covers Latin/Greek/Cyrillic, and script-specific fonts (Noto Sans Arabic, Noto Sans Devanagari, Noto Sans Thai, the region-specific Noto Sans CJK SC/TC/JP/KR) extend it. How you handle non-Latin text depends on the script, and CJK is the case people most often get wrong.

**CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) — rendered locally by default; do not serve CJK glyph PBFs.** GL JS's `localIdeographFontFamily` map option defaults to `'sans-serif'`, so CJK characters are generated on-device (TinySDF), and `text-font` is **ignored** for them (except the weight keyword). This exists because CJK text has poor locality across Unicode ranges: a single tile can otherwise trigger dozens of large glyph requests.[2] Leave it on; optionally point it at a nicer on-device CJK font. Setting `localIdeographFontFamily: false` restores served glyphs for CJK, which is much slower — only do it if you specifically need the served font's shapes.

```javascript
const map = new maplibregl.Map({
  // ...
  localIdeographFontFamily: '"Noto Sans CJK SC", sans-serif' // optional; default is 'sans-serif'
});
```

**Other non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, …) — need real glyphs.** `localIdeographFontFamily` does not apply here. Add the relevant Noto script font to the style layer's `text-font` fallback list and serve its glyph PBFs (or rely on the GL JS ≥ 5.11.0 local fallback, which is environment-dependent — see the top of this skill). Font names must match those the glyph server knows.

**Devanagari, Khmer, and other scripts requiring ligatures/reordering — glyphs alone will not fix this.** MapLibre maps each Unicode codepoint to one glyph with no shaping engine (no HarfBuzz/Raqm), so it cannot form the conjuncts and reordering these scripts require — serving the correct font's PBFs will not produce correct-looking text. There is currently no configuration fix; this is a known architectural limitation.[3]

```json
{ "text-font": ["Noto Sans Regular", "Noto Sans Devanagari Regular"] }
```

**Arabic and Hebrew additionally need the RTL text plugin** for correct right-to-left shaping and ordering — glyph coverage alone is not enough. GL JS does not handle RTL by default[1]:

```javascript
import { setRTLTextPlugin } from 'maplibre-gl';
setRTLTextPlugin('https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl-rtl-text.js', null, true);
```

Call this before initializing the map.
