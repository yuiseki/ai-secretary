# TinyClaw

## Quick facts
- Multi-agent orchestration project; memory focus appears to be persistent sessions, not dedicated agent-memory architecture module.

## Relevance check
- No clear custom memory subsystem comparable to OpenClaw memory index.
- `docs/AGENTS.md` references optional shared memory conceptually.
- No concrete `src/*memory*` retrieval/indexing backend found in quick scan.

## Conclusion
- Treat as low-priority comparison target for this memory-architecture report.
- Mention only as non-primary derivative unless deeper memory module is identified.
